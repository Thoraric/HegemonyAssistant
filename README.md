# Hegemony Assistant
An android app to ease the calculations of the production phase in the Hegemony board game. One game round has multiple phases and my goal was to speed up the transition between rounds. There are a lots of calculations in the game that exhaust players' brains and these brainpowers have a better place in mid-turn, when players are deciding the actions.

## Personal Opinion
I truly love the game and this app wasn't made, becase I believe the game has flaws that could have been done better or needs to be improved. The motivation behind this small project was to help people to sit down to the table with this game by making one of the phases much easier. For me as being game master who instructs other players what needs to be done next, I felt exhausted at the end of each round. I become wary after checking the tax table to find how much tax a player needs to pay to the state, also, when the capitalist player has 12 companies, then it is hard to count every single production and wage. As a computer science student I felt that I have the tools and basic knowledge to make an app that can help my games.

## Functionality
This app was designed to do mathematical operations in the "Produces Goods & Services" and "Pay Taxes" steps.

## How to use
1. On the Policies tab, select the active policies by clicking on one of the stages of the policy. 

Important Note: The fiscal policy is not a button, just an image to guide the eyes of the users. It doesn't have any functionality, since fiscal policy doesn't influence the taxation, nor the production.

2. Select the next tab, where you want to do calculations and follow the instructions displayed on your screen. 

Important Note: Taxation related steps are on top of the screen. This design choice was made, because if a user wants to use the app only for taxation, then it is more accessable. The state doesn't have taxation instructions, because it doesn't pay taxes.

3. Scroll down, until you see a list of companies and select the operational companies by tapping on the row. After the tap, it will turn to "Green" to indicate it is selected. You can also unselect it. You have the option to select wheter a working class worker or a middle class worker is working at the company. It will divide the wages accordingly. On capitalist tab you can also select if your company have automation token. On the middle class tab you can specify if your company has the optional working class worker or not. You can see the production and wages at the bottom of the screen. The wages will be counted only if you have one of the wage levels selected by the radio buttons.
